        My approach emphasizes the lifestyle side of fitness with unique programs, individualized exercises,
        and specific food choices tailored to your goals and needs. Whether your focus is muscle gain, fat loss,
        mobility, endurance, nutrition, or more, I’ve helped over 300 people feel, look, and move the way they
        truly want—and you could be next. I work with clients from ages 16 through 65.
